- No useless files/folders.
- No frontend/backend frameworks.
- Only pure PHP and JS written in a clean code with a clean and clear structure.

## Design
- Pure HTML and CSS.
- Simple, modern, and light design.
- Followed UI/UX best practices with multiple media queries.

## APIs
APIs requests and responses are handled and managed dynamically.<br/><br/>
**The used APIs to get categories and courses are cached using JS Session Storage in order to minimize sql queries calls.**<br/><br/>
- `/getCategories`
- `/getCategoryById`
- `/getCategoriesTree` (To get categories in a way that can be easily hierarched in the side panel)
- `/updateCountsOfCourses` (To fill `count_of_courses` column and use less queries at fetching, can act as a trigger)
  
- `/getCourses`
- `/getCourseById`
- `/getCoursesByCategoryId` (To get the courses of children categories)
- `/updateMainCategoriesNames` (To fill `main_category_name` column and use less queries at fetching, can act as a trigger)

- `/migrate` (Migerate all migrations files that is not migrated yet)
- `/rollback` (Rollback all migrated migrations within last minute)
